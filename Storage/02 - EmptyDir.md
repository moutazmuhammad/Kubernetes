# `EmptyDir`: 
### A temporary directory that is created when a pod is created and deleted when the pod is deleted. It can be used to share data between containers in a pod.

* Suppose you have a pod with two containers: a web server and a log collector. The web server writes its log data to a file, and the log collector periodically reads the log data from the file and sends it to a centralized logging system.

- To share the log file between the two containers, you can use an `EmptyDir` volume. Here's an example manifest file that defines the pod:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-log-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-server
    image: my-web-server-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: log-volume
      mountPath: /var/log/myapp
  - name: log-collector
    image: my-log-collector-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: log-volume
      mountPath: /var/log/myapp
  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    emptyDir: {}

```

* In this example, the EmptyDir volume is named `log-volume` and is mounted at the directory `/var/log/myapp` in both containers. This allows the web server to write log data to the file at `/var/log/myapp/access`.log, and the log collector to read the data from the same file and send it to the centralized logging system.

> Note: that the EmptyDir volume type is used in this example because the log data is only needed temporarily and can be discarded when the pod is deleted. If you need to persist the log data beyond the lifetime of the pod, you should consider using a different volume type, such as PersistentVolumeClaim.
