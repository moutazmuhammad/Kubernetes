# SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates

## are digital certificates that `verify` the identity of a website `and encrypt the communication between a user's web browser and the website's server`.

## How SSL certificates work?

### 1- A website owner obtains an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
### 2- The SSL certificate contains information about the website, such as its name, address, and public key.
### 3- When a user visits the website, their browser requests the SSL certificate from the website's server.
### 4- The server sends the SSL certificate to the user's browser.
### 5- The user's browser checks the SSL certificate's validity to ensure it is issued by a trusted CA and that it matches the website's domain name.
### 6- If the SSL certificate is valid, the user's browser establishes a secure connection with the website's server and encrypts all data transmitted between the two.
### 7- The user can then interact with the website securely, and any sensitive information transmitted between the two is protected by encryption.
