# `ConfigMap`: 
### A volume that is used to store configuration data that can be shared between containers in a pod.

* Suppose you have a pod with a single container that needs to read configuration data. For example, the container may need to read the database connection string or the API endpoint URL.

* To provide the configuration data to the container, you can use a ConfigMap volume. Here's an example manifest file that defines the pod and the ConfigMap:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  database-url: "postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname"
  api-url: "http://api.example.com"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-config
      mountPath: /config
  volumes:
  - name: my-config
    configMap:
      name: my-configmap

```

* In this example, the ConfigMap volume is named "my-configmap" and includes two pieces of configuration data: the `database-url` and the `api-url`.

* The Pod definition includes a container named "my-container" that mounts the ConfigMap volume at `/config`. This allows the container to read the configuration data provided by the ConfigMap.

* When the pod is created, Kubernetes will mount the ConfigMap data as files into the container at the specified mount path. In this example, the `database-url` configuration data will be available in the file `/config/database-url` and the api-url configuration data will be available in the file `/config/api-url`.

> Note: that the ConfigMap volume type is useful for providing configuration data to containers. However, it is not suitable for providing large amounts of data or binary data. For those use cases, you should consider using a different volume type, such as EmptyDir, HostPath, or PersistentVolumeClaim.
