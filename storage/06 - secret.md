# `Secret`: 
### A volume that is used to store sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, that can be shared between containers in a pod.
Suppose you have a pod with a single container that needs to access sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys. To protect this data, you can use a Secret volume.

Here's an example manifest file that defines the pod and the Secret:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4= # Base64 encoded "admin"
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ= # Base64 encoded "password"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-secrets
      mountPath: /secrets
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: my-secrets
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret
```



* In this example, the Secret volume is named "my-secret" and includes two pieces of sensitive data: the username and the password. The data is base64 encoded to protect it from prying eyes.

* The Pod definition includes a container named "my-container" that mounts the Secret volume at `/secrets`. The readOnly option is set to true to prevent the container from modifying the contents of the Secret.

* When the pod is created, Kubernetes will mount the Secret data as files into the container at the specified mount path. In this example, the username and password data will be available in the files `/secrets/username` and `/secrets/password`, respectively.

> Note: that the Secret volume type is useful for protecting sensitive data. However, it is not suitable for providing large amounts of data or binary data. For those use cases, you should consider using a different volume type, such as EmptyDir, HostPath, or PersistentVolumeClaim.
